# Symmetric Binary Tree Checker

This project checks whether a binary tree is **symmetric** around its center using C++.

---

## Problem

A binary tree is symmetric if the left subtree is a mirror reflection of the right subtree.  

- Example symmetric tree:

```
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
